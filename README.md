![BlogComponent](./docs/BlogC.png)

The blog page contains a set of links with date/time stamps. Each link takes the user to the associate blog further down the page. This component contains links, text, time/date and image elements.

## WIREFRAMES

The layout of the page is designed to be responsive to multiple different device widths. The media breakpoints used are:

- smaller mobile devices < 400px wide
- modern mobile devices < 500px wide
- tablets < 900px
- desktop and laptop displays > 900px

The general idea is that horizontal content is converted into vertical content as the screen gets smaller. For example, adjacent images would stack on top of each other, or a text would appear below its associated image.

The colour scheme for the site was chosen to invoke a synthwave aethestic and emphasise the game development and creative side of the portfolio. Lighter colours were used for text and accents, the darker colours were used to provide contrast and a darker background so that content can stand out.

All links change to an accent colour when hovered over to indicate to the user that it is a link
